I built a digit classifier using TensorFlow to learn about image classification.

After training the model, I exported the inference graph to be hosted on a website.

Then I built a website that asks users a math question, and provides an area for users to draw the answer. Using the digit classifier, we check if the proided answer was correct. If the answer was correct, flowers are added to the website. If the answer was incorrect, flowers go away.
